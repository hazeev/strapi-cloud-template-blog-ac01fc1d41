Digit entry views
A digit entry view fills the entire screen and prompts people to enter a series of digits, like a PIN, using a digit-specific keyboard.

You can add an optional title and prompt above the line of digits.

Best practices
Use secure digit fields. Secure digit fields display asterisks instead of the entered digit onscreen. Always use a secure digit field when your app asks for sensitive data.

Clearly state the purpose of the digit entry view. Use a title and prompt that explains why someone needs to enter digits.

Platform considerations
Not supported in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, or watchOS.
