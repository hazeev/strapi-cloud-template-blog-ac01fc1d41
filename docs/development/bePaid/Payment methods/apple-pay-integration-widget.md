# Apple Pay on the payment widget - bePaid API Documentation
bePaid made the Apple Pay integration easy and hassle-free for those merchants who use the bePaid payment widget, payment links or payment page to accept payments online.

No need to open a payment session with Apple, to validate your domain and to pass `PaymentToken` in requests. bePaid takes care of everything.

Follow the steps below:

1.  Incorporate [the bePaid payment widget](https://docs.bepaid.by/en/integration/widget/setup/) or get [payment links](https://docs.bepaid.by/en/integration/pay_by_link/index.html) for your products.
    
2.  Make sure that you finished [the registration](https://docs.bepaid.by/en/payment_methods/apple_pay/registration/) with Apple.
    
3.  Contact your account manager to get Apple Pay activated.
    
    Once Apple Pay is activated, you can see Apple Pay among the active payment brands for your shops in the bePaid back office. Apple Pay button is displayed to your customers if the Apple service is supported on their devices.
    
4.  Send payment requests as described for the integration option you use.
