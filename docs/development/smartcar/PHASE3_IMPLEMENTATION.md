# Smartcar Phase 3: Fuel & Charging Tracking Implementation

## Overview

Phase 3 implements automatic fuel fill-up and EV charging session detection from Smartcar vehicle data. The system analyzes fuel level and battery level changes to automatically create fuel entries in Carvetka when significant increases are detected.

**Completion Date:** January 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Type-Safe

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Fuel Fill-Up Detection

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of fuel fill-ups by comparing current and previous fuel levels
- Threshold-based detection: >5% increase OR >5 liters/gallons increase
- Creates fuel_entries with accurate odometer readings
- Links to meter_entries when available
- Determines fuel volume units automatically (liters vs gallons)
- Respects user currency preferences

**Components:**
- `detectFuelFillUp()` - Compares fuel levels to identify fill-ups
- `createFuelEntryFromSmartcar()` - Creates fuel entry with proper validation
- `processFuelLevelUpdate()` - Main orchestrator for fuel tracking
- `getLastFuelSync()` - Retrieves previous fuel sync data for comparison

**Data Flow:**
```
Smartcar Fuel Update (webhook or manual sync)
  ↓
processFuelLevelUpdate()
  ↓
detectFuelFillUp() → Compare with previous sync
  ↓
If fill-up detected → createFuelEntryFromSmartcar()
  ↓
fuel_entries table + smartcar_sync_logs
```

### 2. EV Charging Session Detection

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of charging sessions for electric vehicles
- Threshold-based detection: >5% increase OR >20 km range increase
- Creates fuel_entries with `fuel_type = 'electric'`
- Estimates kWh charged based on range increase (~6 km per kWh)
- Tracks charging sessions as fuel entries for unified expense tracking

**Components:**
- `detectChargingSession()` - Compares battery levels to identify charging
- `createChargingEntryFromSmartcar()` - Creates charging entry with kWh estimate
- `processBatteryLevelUpdate()` - Main orchestrator for EV charging tracking
- `getLastBatterySync()` - Retrieves previous battery sync data for comparison

**Data Flow:**
```
Smartcar Battery Update (webhook or manual sync)
  ↓
processBatteryLevelUpdate()
  ↓
detectChargingSession() → Compare with previous sync
  ↓
If charging detected → createChargingEntryFromSmartcar()
  ↓
fuel_entries table (fuel_type='electric') + smartcar_sync_logs
```

### 3. Fuel Economy Calculation

**Features:**
- Calculates fuel economy between consecutive full-tank fill-ups
- Supports both MPG (miles per gallon) and L/100km (liters per 100 km)
- Provides statistics: average, best, and worst fuel economy
- Validates distance traveled (0-10000 km range)
- Only calculates for full-tank entries

**Components:**
- `calculateFuelEconomy()` - Calculates economy between two fill-ups
- `getFuelEconomyStats()` - Provides aggregate statistics for a car

**Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
// For liters:
economy = (fuelConsumed / distanceTraveled) * 100  // L/100km

// For gallons:
distanceMiles = distanceTraveled * 0.621371
economy = distanceMiles / fuelConsumed  // MPG
```

### 4. Webhook Integration

**Enhanced webhook endpoint** (`/api/smartcar/webhook/route.ts`):
- Processes `VEHICLE_STATE` events with fuel/battery data
- Handles dedicated `fuel` and `battery` event types
- Links fuel entries to concurrent odometer readings
- Logs all processing results to `smartcar_sync_logs`

### 5. Manual Sync Enhancement

**Updated `syncVehicleData()`** in `smartcar-server.ts`:
- Fetches fuel level and detects fill-ups during manual sync
- Fetches battery level and detects charging sessions (for EVs)
- Links fuel/charging entries to concurrent meter entries
- Comprehensive logging of all detections

## Files Modified

## Database Schema Usage

### fuel_entries Table

**Fields Used for Smartcar:**
```sql
car_id              -- Links to car
meter_entry_id      -- Links to concurrent odometer reading (if available)
entry_date          -- Timestamp of fill-up/charging detection
odometer_reading    -- Current odometer reading
fuel_volume         -- Volume added (liters/gallons) or kWh charged
fuel_volume_unit    -- 'liters' | 'gallons_us' | 'gallons_uk'
cost_per_unit       -- Set to 0 (Smartcar doesn't provide pricing)
total_cost          -- Set to 0 (Smartcar doesn't provide pricing)
currency            -- From user preferences
fuel_type           -- 'regular' | 'diesel' | 'electric' etc.
is_full_tank        -- true if percentRemaining > 95%
notes               -- Auto-generated description with details
```

**Note:** For EVs, `fuel_volume` stores kWh and `fuel_volume_unit` is set to 'liters' as a workaround (no kWh unit in schema).

### smartcar_sync_logs Table

**New sync_type Values:**
- `'fuel'` - Fuel level syncs with fill-up detection results
- `'battery'` - Battery level syncs with charging detection results

**Data Stored:**
```json
{
  "percentRemaining": 85,
  "amountRemaining": 45.5,
  "range": 450,
  "fillUpDetected": true,  // or chargingSessionDetected
  "fuelEntryId": "uuid"
}
```

## Detection Thresholds

### Fuel Fill-Up Detection

**Triggers:**
- Percentage increase > 5% OR
- Volume increase > 5 liters/gallons

**Rationale:**
- Dual threshold catches both small and large tank fill-ups
- 5% catches partial fill-ups on large tanks
- 5 L/gal catches small tanks with full fill-ups

### EV Charging Detection

**Triggers:**
- Battery percentage increase > 5% OR
- Range increase > 20 km

**Rationale:**
- 5% catches all meaningful charging sessions
- 20 km range catches rapid chargers with small percentage gains
- Filters out normal battery fluctuations

## Unit Handling

### Fuel Volume
- Smartcar returns fuel in liters or gallons
- Heuristic: if `amountRemaining > 100`, assume liters; otherwise gallons
- **Recommendation:** Enhance with car location or user preference

### Distance
- All odometer readings stored in kilometers internally
- Automatic conversion from miles: `miles * 1.60934`
- Fuel economy calculations handle unit differences

### Energy (EVs)
- Battery range stored in kilometers
- kWh estimate: `rangeIncrease / 6` (rough average: 6 km per kWh)
- **Note:** This is a rough estimate; actual efficiency varies by vehicle

## Cost Tracking

### Automatic Entries (Limitations)

**Smartcar does NOT provide:**
- Fuel/charging costs
- Fuel station information
- Transaction details

**Fields Set to Defaults:**
```typescript
cost_per_unit: 0
total_cost: 0
fuel_station: undefined
```

### User Can Edit Later

Users can manually edit Smartcar-created fuel entries to add:
- Actual costs (total_cost, cost_per_unit)
- Fuel station name/location
- Additional notes

## Integration Points

### Webhooks (Real-Time)

**Event Types Handled:**
1. `VEHICLE_STATE` - Composite event with odometer + fuel/battery
2. `fuel` / `vehicle.fuel` - Dedicated fuel events
3. `battery` / `vehicle.battery` - Dedicated battery events

**Processing:**
- Concurrent odometer readings linked to fuel/charging entries
- Meter entry IDs passed to fuel entry creation
- All events logged to `smartcar_webhook_events`

### Manual Sync (On-Demand)

**Triggered by:**
- User clicking "Sync Now" button
- Scheduled sync jobs (if implemented)

**Behavior:**
- Fetches all available data (odometer, fuel, battery, vehicle info)
- Processes each data type with fill-up/charging detection
- Creates entries only if significant changes detected
- Updates `last_synced_at` timestamp

## Example Data Flow

### ICE Vehicle Fill-Up

```
1. User fills tank: 10% → 95% (30 liters added)
2. Smartcar webhook received: percentRemaining=95, amountRemaining=45
3. getLastFuelSync() retrieves previous: percentRemaining=10, amountRemaining=15
4. detectFuelFillUp():
   - percentIncrease = 95 - 10 = 85%  ✓ (> 5%)
   - amountIncrease = 45 - 15 = 30 L  ✓ (> 5 L)
   - isFillUp = true
5. createFuelEntryFromSmartcar():
   - car_id: from connection
   - odometer_reading: from concurrent sync
   - fuel_volume: 30.0
   - fuel_volume_unit: 'liters'
   - fuel_type: 'regular'
   - is_full_tank: true (95% > 95%)
   - cost_per_unit: 0
   - total_cost: 0
   - notes: "Fill-up detected: +30.00 (85.0% increase)"
6. Entry created + logged to smartcar_sync_logs
```

### EV Charging Session

```
1. User charges EV: 20% → 80% (+240 km range)
2. Smartcar webhook received: percentRemaining=80, range=320
3. getLastBatterySync() retrieves previous: percentRemaining=20, range=80
4. detectChargingSession():
   - percentIncrease = 80 - 20 = 60%  ✓ (> 5%)
   - rangeIncrease = 320 - 80 = 240 km  ✓ (> 20 km)
   - isChargingSession = true
5. createChargingEntryFromSmartcar():
   - energyEstimateKwh = 240 / 6 = 40 kWh
   - car_id: from connection
   - odometer_reading: from concurrent sync
   - fuel_volume: 40.0 (kWh)
   - fuel_volume_unit: 'liters' (reused for kWh)
   - fuel_type: 'electric'
   - is_full_tank: false (80% < 95%)
   - cost_per_unit: 0
   - total_cost: 0
   - notes: "Charging session detected: +60.0% battery, +240 km range (~40.0 kWh)"
6. Entry created + logged to smartcar_sync_logs
```

## Fuel Economy Example

**Scenario:** Two consecutive full-tank fill-ups

```
Fill-up 1:
- Date: 2025-01-01
- Odometer: 10,000 km
- Volume: 50 liters

Fill-up 2:
- Date: 2025-01-08
- Odometer: 10,600 km
- Volume: 55 liters

Calculation:
- Distance traveled: 10,600 - 10,000 = 600 km
- Fuel consumed: 50 liters (from Fill-up 1)
- Economy: (50 / 600) * 100 = 8.33 L/100km

Stats Over Multiple Fill-Ups:
- Average: 8.5 L/100km
- Best: 7.2 L/100km (most efficient)
- Worst: 9.8 L/100km (least efficient)
```

## Logging & Observability

### Console Logs

**Fill-Up Detected:**
```
✓ Created fuel entry for car abc-123: 30.00 liters added (95.0% remaining)
```

**No Fill-Up:**
```
No fill-up detected for car abc-123 (change: 2.3%)
```

**Charging Detected:**
```
✓ Charging session detected for EV abc-456: 40.0 kWh estimated (60.0% increase)
```

### Database Logs

All sync operations logged to `smartcar_sync_logs`:
- Timestamp of sync
- Data received from Smartcar
- Detection results (fillUpDetected, chargingSessionDetected)
- Created entry IDs for traceability

## Known Limitations

### 1. Cost Data
**Issue:** Smartcar API doesn't provide fuel/charging costs
**Workaround:** Users must manually edit entries to add costs
**Future:** Could integrate with fuel price APIs based on location

### 2. Unit Detection
**Issue:** Fuel volume unit determined by heuristic (>100 = liters)
**Workaround:** Works for most vehicles
**Future:** Store user preference or use car location (US = gallons, elsewhere = liters)

### 3. EV kWh Estimation
**Issue:** Range-to-kWh conversion uses rough average (6 km/kWh)
**Workaround:** Provides approximate tracking
**Future:** Use vehicle-specific efficiency from NHTSA data or user calibration

### 4. First Sync
**Issue:** Can't detect fill-up/charging on first sync (no previous data)
**Expected:** Normal behavior; detection starts from second sync
**Future:** Could prompt user to confirm initial level

### 5. Database Schema
**Issue:** No dedicated kWh unit; reusing 'liters' for EV charging
**Workaround:** Notes field clarifies it's kWh
**Future:** Add 'kwh' to FuelVolumeUnit enum

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Fill-Up Detection (ICE):**
   - Start with low fuel level (< 20%)
   - Trigger manual sync
   - Fill tank to > 95%
   - Trigger manual sync again
   - Verify fuel_entry created

2. **Charging Detection (EV):**
   - Start with low battery (< 30%)
   - Trigger manual sync
   - Charge to > 80%
   - Trigger manual sync again
   - Verify fuel_entry created with fuel_type='electric'

3. **Webhook Testing:**
   - Configure webhook in Smartcar dashboard
   - Drive vehicle / charge EV
   - Check `smartcar_webhook_events` table for events
   - Verify automatic entry creation

4. **Fuel Economy:**
   - Create 2+ full-tank fill-ups with different odometer readings
   - Call `getFuelEconomyStats(carId)`
   - Verify calculation accuracy

### Edge Cases

1. **Partial Fill-Up:** Should detect if > 5% or > 5 L
2. **Top-Off:** Small additions (< 5% and < 5 L) should not trigger
3. **Battery Fluctuation:** Small changes (< 5% and < 20 km) should not trigger
4. **Odometer Rollback:** Detection should skip invalid entries
5. **Multiple Syncs:** Should not create duplicates for same fill-up

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Uses `single()` for latest sync retrieval (indexed on `created_at`)
- Filters by `smartcar_vehicle_id` (indexed)
- Limits `meter_entries` query to 1 result

### Background Processing
- All detection logic runs asynchronously
- Webhook responses return 200 immediately after logging
- Processing errors don't block webhook acknowledgment

## Security

### Data Privacy
- Fuel/battery data stored with user's other vehicle data
- RLS policies apply (users see only their data)
- Smartcar tokens securely stored and refreshed

### Validation
- Duplicate detection prevents data corruption
- Odometer validation prevents invalid entries
- Unit conversion validated for accuracy

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4 Candidates

1. **Cost Integration:**
   - Integrate fuel price APIs (e.g., GasBuddy)
   - Estimate costs based on location and fuel type
   - Charging cost estimation based on electricity rates

2. **Improved Detection:**
   - Machine learning to learn user patterns
   - Vehicle-specific calibration
   - Confidence scores for detections

3. **Additional Metrics:**
   - Idle time tracking
   - Trip-based fuel economy
   - Driving behavior analysis

4. **UI Enhancements:**
   - Fuel entry review before saving
   - Bulk cost editing
   - Fuel economy charts and trends

5. **Notifications:**
   - Alert on detected fill-up/charging

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** No fill-ups detected
**Check:**
- Is this the first sync? (needs previous data)
- Does change meet threshold? (> 5% or > 5 L)
- Check `smartcar_sync_logs` for raw data

**Issue:** Wrong fuel volume unit
**Check:**
- Review heuristic (> 100 = liters)
- Check user's location (US vs international)
- Manually correct if needed

**Issue:** EV kWh estimates seem off
**Check:**
- Vehicle efficiency may differ from 6 km/kWh
- Range estimates can be inaccurate
- Use as approximation, not absolute value

**Issue:** Costs are all $0
**Expected:** Smartcar doesn't provide cost data
**Action:** User must manually edit entries

### Debug Logs

Enable verbose logging:
```typescript
// In fuel-entries-server.ts
console.log('Fuel detection:', {
  carId,
  previousFuel,
  currentFuel,
  percentIncrease,
  isFillUp
})
```

## Conclusion
