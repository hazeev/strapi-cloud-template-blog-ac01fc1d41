# Configure Your Application

Learn how to configure your Smartcar application, including setting up permissions and redirect URIs.

Once you have registered your application in the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com), you can configure it to suit your business needs.

## Application Configuration Overview

Your application configuration includes several key components:

- **Application Name & Description**: A clear name and description help users understand what your application does.
- **Redirect URI**: The URL to which users will be redirected after they authorize your application. This must match the redirect URI you use in your OAuth flow.
- **Privacy Policy URL**: A link to your applicationâ€™s privacy policy that will be presented to users during the authorization process.
- **Vehicle Data**: Select the specific vehicle data signals your application will request access to. This determines the permissions your application will need from users.
